In recent years, the emergence of ChatGPT and Deepseek has brought the development of AIGC to a new climax. After reading several works in this field by Chinese professors Zhou Zhihua and He Kaiming, I felt more development possibilities of this major in the future. Particularly in the fields of machine learning and reinforcement learning, I have come to recognize the immense value of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Whether it is analyzing traffic flow through large-scale models to enable smart cities, classifying facial recognition data, conducting sentiment analysis in natural language processing, or even training AI models to detect AI-generated forgeries (the focus of my graduation research project), I have been consistently inspired by the transformative potential of AI. This realization not only aligns with my initial motivation for studying AI but also defines the direction I aspire to pursue in my future research endeavors.

During my undergraduate study at Ocean University of China, I studied machine learning, optimization theory, computer vision, natural language processing, intelligent computing systems, and other courses. In the final project of the computer vision course, I tried to use the diffusion model, which is the most commonly used in the AIGC neighborhood, that is, to apply artificial intelligence technology to the image processing field, and achieved preliminary results. This interdisciplinary practice made me realize the broader application prospects of artificial intelligence. At the same time, the extensive formula derivation exercises in courses such as machine learning greatly improved my mathematical abilities. I have mastered programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. I can skillfully apply relevant regression and models of artificial intelligence, such as perceptron, support vector machine, naive Bayes model, and so on. I also actively keep up with the forefront of the artificial intelligence industry and have mastered the construction and use of GAN networks and diffusion models. The knowledge taught in school enabled me to gain a holistic perspective on artificial intelligence, which is crucial for solving problems in this field.

To apply this knowledge to professional scenarios, I initiated a study of six chess games as the team leader. In aspects such as board representation, chess path evaluation, and trend judgment, we optimized to find the best strategy to improve the winning rate of the game. This was undoubtedly a great challenge to my modeling thinking and algorithmic abilities. After collaborative research with team members and a lot of trial and error, we established an evaluation function to calculate the situation through the "chess path" idea and used the α-β pruning algorithm to reduce the number of minimax algorithm evaluation nodes in the search tree. The DTSS function and iterative algorithm were used to implement a dual threat search algorithm, which can avoid invalid moves and improve the efficiency of the program. In this project, my technical application and programming abilities were greatly improved, and I gradually understood the implementation principles and methods of programs like AlphaGo. With the deepening of my understanding of artificial intelligence technology, I began to further combine artificial intelligence technology with practice. I innovatively introduced large models such as ERNIE Bot and Stable Diffusion into the construction of the mental health cloud platform of Ocean University of China, empowering the construction of an information platform. These practical experiences not only consolidated my technical proficiency but also enhanced my ability to face challenges and solve problems innovatively. Finally, I participated in the technology transfer project between Ocean University of China and Stanford Qingdao Research Institute, and supplemented my knowledge in market research and intellectual property law to further broaden my horizons.

As I mentioned, I hope to apply artificial intelligence technology to more realistic scenarios, bring more and richer value to humanity through cutting-edge technology, and solve more social problems. This prompted me to apply for the Combined Master’s & Doctoral Programs in Computer Engineering at Seoul National University in South Korea. The program's interdisciplinary approach and balanced curriculum make it an ideal platform for me to continue growing in this era of ubiquitous computing. Seoul National University's strong academic background in the field of AI, as well as its many breakthrough achievements in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI sub-fields, allow me to fully perceive the forefront of the industry. The program's emphasis on AI-related applications of mathematics, statistics, and computer science will help me become a more well-rounded AI researcher to tackle various real-world challenges in the field of artificial intelligence.

My undergraduate coursework, coupled with my high academic achievements, has prepared me well for this research focus. I am particularly interested in advancing the field of Multimodal Joint Forgery Detection in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content), which involves constructing large-scale models using deep learning techniques. In the long term, I aspire to refine my current concept of "Deep Interactive Anti-Counterfeiting through Multimodal Features" and publish a paper on this topic at AAAI.

To be specific, the field of DeepFake detection presents significant challenges and opportunities. While models like CLIP, BLIP, and ViLT have achieved over 98% accuracy in generative tasks, the accuracy of DeepFake detection models remains around 88%, indicating a need for further research. Current methodologies often focus on temporal patterns or visual frameworks, but there is a lack of efficient and accurate multimodal approaches. My undergraduate research project addressed this gap by proposing a method that emphasizes deeper integration of multimodal features. However, this approach still has limitations, and I am eager to explore it further.
